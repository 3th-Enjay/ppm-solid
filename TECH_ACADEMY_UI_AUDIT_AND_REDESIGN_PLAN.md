# Technology Academy — UI Audit and Redesign Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1. Context and Objective
This audit and redesign plan establishes the architectural and visual roadmap to transform the **Prompt Care Academy** Learning Management System (LMS)—originally conceived as a healthcare and caregiver vocational training platform—into a premier, modern **Technology Academy for practical technology skills**.

The platform provides training in software engineering, frontend and backend development, artificial intelligence, data science, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and product design. The engineering challenge is that while recent backend and persistence initiatives ([`TECH_ACADEMY_POSTGRES_RUNTIME_HARDENING.md`](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/v0-lms-with-mongo-db/TECH_ACADEMY_POSTGRES_RUNTIME_HARDENING.md) and [`TECH_ACADEMY_ACADEMIC_PERSISTENCE.md`](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/v0-lms-with-mongo-db/TECH_ACADEMY_ACADEMIC_PERSISTENCE.md)) have decoupled the application from MongoDB, established deterministic PostgreSQL execution, and created persistent academic evaluation data models (quizzes, assignments, rubrics, multi-version grade revisions, and capstone projects), the user-facing interface remains heavily saturated with healthcare-specific branding, caregiver terminology, clinical imagery, hospital references, and legacy physical training assumptions.

### 1.2. Scope and Non-Negotiable Boundaries
- **Preserve Working Architecture:** The application operates on Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Radix UI primitives, Framer Motion, and Drizzle ORM on PostgreSQL. Working API handlers, authentication guards, payment verification hooks (Paystack), and academic persistence workflows must be retained without disruption.
- **Fail-Closed PostgreSQL Persistence:** As verified in [`TECH_ACADEMY_STAGING_RELEASE_READINESS.md`](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/v0-lms-with-mongo-db/TECH_ACADEMY_STAGING_RELEASE_READINESS.md), the system strictly executes on PostgreSQL. No fallback to MongoDB or mock stores shall be reintroduced, and no schema migrations or destructive database operations may be executed for purely visual adjustments.
- **Evidence-Based Grounding:** Every route, component, file path, and token referenced in this audit corresponds to verified repository files.

## 4. Existing UI Assessment

### 4.1. Strengths to Preserve
1. **Solid Foundation of Primitives:** Complete integration of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS provides robust dialogs, accessible dropdowns, responsive sheets, accessible accordions, and clean tabs.
2. **Smooth Micro-interactions:** Framer Motion animation presets (`fadeUp`, `sectionStagger`, `slowZoom`) provide polished transitions without degrading performance when reduced motion is requested.
3. **Responsive Role Consoles:** `RoleDashboardShell` provides consistent sidebar/topbar navigation with mobile slide-out drawers across all four roles.
4. **Recent Academic Panels:** The newly introduced [`QuizRunner`](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/v0-lms-with-mongo-db/components/academic/QuizRunner.tsx), [`AssignmentSubmissionPanel`](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/v0-lms-with-mongo-db/components/academic/AssignmentSubmissionPanel.tsx), and [`CapstoneProjectPanel`](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/v0-lms-with-mongo-db/components/academic/CapstoneProjectPanel.tsx) function with server-side validation and anti-cheat protections.
5. **Multi-Currency Architecture:** Reliable currency switcher (`NGN`, `USD`, `EUR`, `GBP`) with Paystack integration.

### 4.2. Inconsistencies & UX Defects
1. **Color Token Misalignment:** The primary green (`#16a34a`) evokes clinical nursing scrubs and pharmacy branding rather than a modern technology academy.
2. **Disconnected Instructor Workflow:** Although PostgreSQL now stores rubrics, assignment submissions, capstone submissions, and grade history revisions, the Instructor navigation sidebar ([`app/instructor/layout.tsx`](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/v0-lms-with-mongo-db/app/instructor/layout.tsx)) does not link to submissions or grading workflows. Instructors have no dedicated dashboard page to review pending submissions or apply rubrics.
3. **Broken Navigation Links:** In `app/instructor/layout.tsx`, "Create Course" links to `/instructor/courses/new`, whereas the actual route in the repository is `/instructor/create-course`.
4. **Mobile Header Clutter:** In `dashboard-header.tsx` and `role-dashboard-shell.tsx`, the mobile header displays multiple redundant brand texts and logo icons within a 44px vertical strip.
5. **Hardcoded Clinical Assets in Layouts:** Several marketing cards render direct URLs to remote Pexels photos depicting hospital wards and patient consultations.
6. **Accessibility & Contrast Concerns:**
   - Light mode secondary button borders (`border-accent/40` on white) fail WCAG 2.1 AA 3:1 contrast ratios for UI components.
   - Text inputs with placeholder-only labels in [`contact/page.tsx`](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/v0-lms-with-mongo-db/app/%28public%29/contact/page.tsx) present accessibility risks when autofilled.
   - In `app/globals.css`, outline styles rely on `outline-ring/50`, which lacks visible contrast against dark card surfaces.

## 5. Proposed Visual Direction

### 5.1. Design Philosophy
The redesign will project **engineering credibility, academic rigor, and practical career focus**. It must feel like an established technology institution (reminiscent of MIT OpenCourseWare, Vercel Academy, and modern developer documentation) rather than a generic bootcamp template.

### 5.2. Recommended Color Palette
We replace the healthcare scrub-green palette with an **Electric Slate & Deep Tech Indigo** system, complemented by a vibrant **Cyan / Cobalt** interactive accent:

```css
/* Proposed Light Mode Tokens */
:root {
  --background: #f8fafc;           /* Slate 50: clean, high-clarity background */
  --foreground: #0f172a;           /* Slate 900: high-contrast readable typography */
  --card: #ffffff;                 /* Pure white card surface */
  --card-foreground: #0f172a;
  
  --primary: #2563eb;              /* Tech Royal Blue (accessible 4.5:1+ contrast) */
  --primary-foreground: #ffffff;
  
  --secondary: #f1f5f9;            /* Slate 100 */
  --secondary-foreground: #1e293b;
  
  --accent: #0284c7;               /* Sky / Cyan 600 for badges and active states */
  --accent-foreground: #ffffff;
  
  --muted: #f1f5f9;
  --muted-foreground: #64748b;     /* Slate 500 */
  
  --border: #e2e8f0;               /* Slate 200 */
  --ring: #3b82f6;                 /* Blue 500 focus indicator */
  
  --radius: 0.625rem;              /* Refined, modern corner radius */
}

/* Proposed Dark Mode Tokens */
.dark {
  --background: #090d16;           /* Deep midnight tech navy */
  --foreground: #f8fafc;
  --card: #111827;                 /* Slate 900 elevation */
  --card-foreground: #f8fafc;
  
  --primary: #3b82f6;              /* Blue 500 */
  --primary-foreground: #020617;
  
  --secondary: #1e293b;            /* Slate 800 */
  --secondary-foreground: #f8fafc;
  
  --accent: #38bdf8;               /* Sky 400 */
  --accent-foreground: #031020;
  
  --muted: #1e293b;
  --muted-foreground: #94a3b8;
  
  --border: #1e293b;
  --ring: #60a5fa;
}
```

### 5.3. Typography & Hierarchy
- **Primary Body Font:** Inter (clean, highly readable across code snippets and dense tables).
- **Headings & Display:** Plus Jakarta Sans or a clean Geist-inspired sans, maintaining tight tracking (`-0.02em`) for modern technical authority.
- **Monospace Font:** JetBrains Mono or Fira Code (`ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas`) for course codes, terminal commands, commit hashes, and rubric metrics.

### 5.4. Layout, Card Styling & Imagery
- **Subtle Elevation:** Soft, crisp borders (`border-border/80`) paired with subtle shadows (`0 4px 20px -2px rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.05)`).
- **Elimination of Healthcare Elements:** No stethoscopes, medical crosses, hospital corridors, or clinical scrubs.
- **Technology Imagery:**
  - Code editors, syntax-highlighted snippets, architecture block diagrams, cloud infrastructure topologies.
  - Students collaborating in modern tech workstations with dual monitors and laptops.
  - Authentic project deliverables (GitHub commits, API responses, responsive web apps).

## 7. Role-by-Role Experience Plan

### 7.1. Student Experience
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Student Login] --> B[Student Dashboard]
    B --> C[Active Enrolled Courses]
    B --> D[Next Learning Action / Streak]
    B --> E[Recent Academic Feedback & Grades]
    C --> F[Course Learn Page]

    F --> I[Multi-Attempt Assignment Panel]
    F --> J[Capstone Project Deliverable Submission]
    J --> K[View Released Grade & Rubric Breakdown]
```

- **Dashboard Redesign:** Remove `<OnsiteTrainingBanner />`. Introduce a **"Learning Path & Academic Progress"** hero displaying active course cards with progress rings, upcoming assignment deadlines, and quick access to recent instructor feedback.
- **Learn Page Refinement:** 
  - Enhance video viewing with dark cinematic canvas and keyboard shortcuts (space for play/pause).
  - Polish the [`QuizRunner`](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/v0-lms-with-mongo-db/components/academic/QuizRunner.tsx) card with clear question step indicators, timer countdown, and post-submission results breakdown.
  - Enhance [`AssignmentSubmissionPanel`](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/v0-lms-with-mongo-db/components/academic/AssignmentSubmissionPanel.tsx) with validation for repository URLs (GitHub/GitLab) and preview badges.
  - Polish [`CapstoneProjectPanel`](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/v0-lms-with-mongo-db/components/academic/CapstoneProjectPanel.tsx) to showcase architecture notes, live demo links, and rubrics.

### 7.2. Instructor Experience
- **Bridge the Persistence Gap:** While PostgreSQL contains `rubrics`, `grades`, `grade_history`, and `assignment_submissions`, the instructor UI lacked a dedicated review workspace.
- **Curriculum & Grading Console:**
  - Update `instructorNavItems` in [`app/instructor/layout.tsx`](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/v0-lms-with-mongo-db/app/instructor/layout.tsx) to include **"Submissions & Grading"** (`/instructor/grading` or `/instructor/submissions`).
  - Fix broken route: Change Create Course href from `/instructor/courses/new` to `/instructor/create-course`.
  - Provide an interactive rubric evaluation modal where instructors assign points per rubric criterion, record feedback remarks, and view audit history for revised grades.

### 7.3. Administrator Experience
- **Platform Governance & Taxonomy:**
  - Modernize course management: allow tagging courses by tech stack (`TypeScript`, `Next.js`, `Docker`, `Python`).
  - Isolate or adapt legacy modules: Rebrand `/admin/onsite-training` to "Cohort Management" and `/admin/campaign` to "Promotions".
  - Refine Settings: In `/admin/settings`, allow updating academy name, support contact, and branding assets without touching database schemas.

### 7.4. Finance Experience
- **Trustworthy Financial Interface:**
  - Preserve the verified Paystack transaction verification and refund mechanics.
  - Upgrade table formatting: render Paystack reference codes in monospace font (`font-mono text-xs`), with one-click copy.
  - Maintain multi-currency revenue breakdown (`NGN`, `USD`, `EUR`, `GBP`) with clean Recharts bar and status distribution charts.

---

## 8. Shared Component & Design-Token Plan

### 8.1. Components to Standardize and Reuse
- **`components/ui/card.tsx`:** Standardize on crisp `variant="elevated"` with `rounded-xl` and 1px `border-border/80`.
- **`components/ui/badge.tsx`:** Refactor status colors:
  - `success`: Emerald 600 text with 10% tint (grades passed, completed payments).
  - `info` / `tech`: Sky/Blue 600 text (in-progress courses, assignments submitted).
  - `warning`: Amber 600 text (draft status, revision requested).
  - `destructive`: Rose 600 text (failed quiz attempt, overdue deadline).
- **`components/ui/button.tsx`:** Standardize `variant="cta"` to tech primary blue (`bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white shadow-sm`). Remove green glow shadow utilities.
- **`components/ui/input.tsx` & `textarea.tsx`:** Ensure clean focus rings with `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-blue-500/30`.

### 8.2. Components to Introduce or Upgrade
1. **`components/ui/tech-logo.tsx`:** An SVG-based responsive brand component supporting `"full"`, `"mark"`, and `"inverted"` variants, replacing all direct imports of `/promptcare-icon.png`.
2. **`components/academic/SubmissionGradingModal.tsx`:** Reusable dialog for instructors to review submitted code links, apply rubric criteria scores, and submit grades directly to `POST /api/courses/[id]/submissions/[submissionId]/grade`.
3. **`components/ui/code-block.tsx`:** Reusable syntax-styled container for technical lesson descriptions and assignment instructions.

---

## 10. Testing & Verification Plan

Every phase must be validated against the project's existing quality gates:

1. **Automated Academic Persistence Tests:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:academic
   ```
   *Verifies that quiz attempts, anti-cheat masking, assignment submissions, rubrics, and capstone submissions continue passing.*
2. **PostgreSQL Runtime Hardening & Staging Tests:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:staging-verify
   npm run test:payments
   npm run test:staging-e2e
   ```
   *Verifies fail-closed PostgreSQL selection, Paystack HMAC payment validation, and role journey security.*
3. **Static Analysis & Type Integrity:**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```
   *Enforces zero ESLint warnings and zero TypeScript compilation errors.*
4. **Production Build Validation:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   *Verifies that all 89 Next.js App Router routes compile successfully with Turbopack.*
5. **Accessibility (a11y) & Contrast Audits:**
   *Verify that all revised text, buttons, and badges meet WCAG 2.1 AA 4.5:1 text contrast and 3:1 UI component contrast.*
6. **Responsive Layout Checks:**
   *Audit at 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1280px (laptop), and 1536px (desktop).*

## 11. Risks, Blockers & Unresolved Decisions

### 11.1. Branding Confirmation
- **Open Item:** The current repository references "Prompt Care Academy" everywhere. While this audit outlines a neutral "Technology Academy" design direction, stakeholder sign-off is needed on the final **official brand name** (e.g. *Prompt Tech Academy*, *SkillUp Tech*, or a new institution name) and corporate domain before updating external DNS, Resend domain verification, or production legal entities.
- **Mitigation:** Abstract the academy name and support email through `lib/admin-settings.ts` and environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME`), allowing instant rebranding across all pages.

### 11.2. Legacy 21-Day Onsite Training Subsystem
- **Open Item:** `app/dashboard/onsite-training` and `app/admin/onsite-training` specifically manage physical 21-day caregiver cohorts in Enugu and Abuja.
- **Decision Needed:** Does the new Technology Academy intend to offer physical in-person coding bootcamps in these cities, or is the platform pivoting to 100% online/remote learning?
- **Recommendation:** If physical bootcamps are planned, rebrand the subsystem to "In-Person Developer Cohorts". If not, cleanly unmount the navigation links and dashboard banners while keeping the underlying data structure intact.

### 11.3. External Cloud Storage for Artifact Uploads
- **Current State:** As identified in [`TECH_ACADEMY_STAGING_RELEASE_READINESS.md`](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/v0-lms-with-mongo-db/TECH_ACADEMY_STAGING_RELEASE_READINESS.md), student assignment files, thumbnails, and capstone artifacts currently rely on external URL inputs (e.g. GitHub links, Figma URLs). Direct file upload (S3 / Cloudflare R2 / Uploadthing) is not yet provisioned.
- **Design Impact:** The UI redesign should continue emphasizing repository and project URLs for technology submissions until a cloud blob storage provider is configured.

---

## 12. Acceptance Criteria

The UI redesign shall be considered complete when:
1. **Zero Healthcare Branding:** A global search across `app/`, `components/`, and `public/` yields zero user-facing occurrences of "Prompt Care", caregiver terminology, hospital imagery, stethoscope icons, or nursing testimonials.
2. **Unified Visual Theme:** The entire platform consistently reflects the Electric Slate / Tech Blue palette with WCAG AA-compliant contrast ratios in both light and dark modes.
3. **Cohesive Experience Across All Roles:**
   - **Students** have a modern learning dashboard with progress rings and seamless access to quizzes, assignments, and capstone projects.
   - **Instructors** have an active submission review interface and rubrics evaluation workflow.
   - **Admins** have modern platform telemetry and clean course management.
   - **Finance operators** have a clear, monospace-styled transaction ledger.
4. **Preserved Backend & Security:** Zero regressions in PostgreSQL persistence, Paystack webhook fulfillment, JWT authentication, and role authorization.
5. **Clean Verification Pipeline:** `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run test:academic`, `npm run test:staging-verify`, and `npm run build` all pass with 0 errors.
